# Conflict Resolution

Distributed systems are messy. Two users might edit the same document while offline. How do we decide who wins?

## Last-Write-Wins (LWW)

GoSync currently uses a **Last-Write-Wins** strategy based on high-precision timestamps.

### How It Works

1. **User A** changes Title to "Draft" at `10:00:01.000`
2. **User B** changes Title to "Final" at `10:00:05.000`
3. **Result:** "Final" wins. User A's edit is overwritten.

```javascript
// Both versions arrive at the server
const versionA = { title: "Draft", updated_at: "2024-01-01T10:00:01.000Z" };
const versionB = { title: "Final", updated_at: "2024-01-01T10:00:05.000Z" };

// GoSync compares timestamps
// versionB.updated_at > versionA.updated_at
// Winner: versionB
```

## Why LWW?

- **Simplicity:** It requires zero configuration from you.
- **Predictability:** The latest action is usually the "correct" one for most CRUD apps (To-Do lists, Settings, Inventory).
- **Performance:** No complex merge algorithms needed.

## Handling Conflicts in Your App

While GoSync handles the technical merge, you might want to notify users when their changes were overwritten.

```javascript
GoSync.onConflict('todos', (local, remote, winner) => {
  if (winner === 'remote') {
    toast.warn('Your changes were overwritten by a newer version');
  }
});
```

## Timestamp Precision

GoSync uses **millisecond-precision ISO 8601 timestamps**. Make sure your client always includes the `updated_at` field:

```javascript
const item = {
  id: 'uuid-1234',
  title: 'My Task',
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString() // "2024-01-01T10:00:01.123Z"
};
```

> **Tip:** If two changes have the exact same timestamp (extremely rare), the server breaks the tie using the item's `id` alphabetically.

## Future Roadmap

> **Coming Soon:** We are researching **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)** for future versions to support collaborative text editing (Google Docs style).
