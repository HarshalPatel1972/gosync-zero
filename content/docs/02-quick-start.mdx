# Quick Start

In this guide, we will add offline sync to a simple Vanilla JS or React application.

## 1. Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @harshalpatel2868/gosync-client
```

## 2. Initialize the Engine

GoSync runs in a Web Worker to keep your UI buttery smooth. Initialize it as early as possible in your app.

```javascript
import { GoSync } from '@harshalpatel2868/gosync-client';

// Initialize with your backend URL
await GoSync.init({
  url: 'ws://localhost:8080/sync',
  debug: true // Enable console logs for development
});
```

## 3. Define Your Data

GoSync is schema-agnostic, but it needs a standard structure to track changes.

```javascript
const task = {
  id: 'uuid-1234',
  title: 'Buy Groceries',
  completed: false,
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString() // Critical for LWW resolution
};
```

## 4. Add & Retrieve Data

Don't use `fetch()`. Use the GoSync API. It handles the saving (IndexedDB) and the syncing (WebSocket) for you.

```javascript
// Add an item (Saved to IndexedDB immediately)
await GoSync.add('todos', task);

// Get all items (Returns from local cache instantly)
const allTodos = await GoSync.get('todos');
console.log(allTodos);
```

## 5. Listen for Updates

When data comes in from the server (e.g., another user edits a task), your UI needs to know.

```javascript
GoSync.subscribe('todos', (newData) => {
  console.log('New data arrived:', newData);
  renderApp(newData);
});
```
